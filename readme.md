# Why No Github?
I don't use Github primarily because it's not Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). I mean, it's proprietary software, yet it hosts open-source projects. To me it kind of feels like itâ€™s opposing the vibe of the whole project. But I still use it for now because itâ€™s popular, and there are some fellow projects I work on that are exclusively hosted on Github.
